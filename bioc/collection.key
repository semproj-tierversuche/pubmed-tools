collection:  PubMed references

    encoding: UTF-8

    source:  PubMed

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date documents downloaded from PubMed

    document:  Title and possibly abstract from a PubMed reference
        id:  PubMed id

        passage:  Either title, abstract or metadata

        infon type: "title", "abstract" or "metadata"

        offset: Text is extracted from an XML file, so literal offsets
                would not be useful. Title has an offset of zero, while
                the abstract is assumed to begin after the title and one
                space. These offsets at least sequence the abstract after
                the title. The sentences in the metadata passage have an
                offset of zero.

        text: The original UTF-8 Unicode text as obtained from the PubMed
              XML

                        qualifier of the current MeSH term.

                            Terms), "NameOfSubstance" in case of chemicals.
